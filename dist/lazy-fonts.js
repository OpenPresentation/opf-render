 * a use asks for (700 for headings and bold runs, 400 for body, 500 to 800 where a design asks).
 *
 * With `registry` (`{faces, policy, aliases, fallbackFamily}`: the faces a registry holds or could hold, `{family, weight,
 * italic}`, and its substitution options) every style resolves as that registry resolves it (`pickFace`, the registry's own
 * selection: the family or its alias or policy replacement, italic before weight, the nearest weight, ties to the
 * lighter), in the two steps drawing takes: a role's family resolves first, then each use's weight resolves within the
 * family found. The result is the faces the registry paints, for example `Intos 700` for a 600-weight label of an Aptos
 * deck. A style the registry cannot resolve is left as named (drawing reports it).
